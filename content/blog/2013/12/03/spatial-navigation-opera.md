# Spatial Navigation & Opera 

![Focus States](/images/blog/2013/12/Focus-Elements.png "240")

## Desktop Opera

On Opera's site it mentions that spatial navigation should be enabled and Shift + Arrow will focus elements on the page. 

This doesn't really work as I'd expect, it won't just start focusing. 

I ended up using tab to step over the focusable elements and in certain scenarios where I found I couldn't reach an element, using the Shift + Arrow key would give the unreachable element focus. 

All in all, a combo of tab and Shift + Arrow should get you there. 

Notes for future self: 

  * Get the Opera TV Emulator
  * Open with Virtual Box
  * F1 acts as a menu option (i.e. show and hide the browser toolbar
  * Shift + Arrow will navigate
  * To access a local server in the virtual box emulator use http://10.0.2.2:
