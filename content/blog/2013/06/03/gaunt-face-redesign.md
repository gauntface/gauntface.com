# Gaunt Face Redesign 

## Question

What happens when a site doesn't click with it's blog counter part, doesn't support mobile devices and is starting to look a little old? 

## Answer

Redesign. 

It's far from finished and still in need of a lot of polish, but hopefully, as people start to use it, I'll find the big issues sooner rather than later :)
