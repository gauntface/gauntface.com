# Royal Parks Half Marathon 

Well it was an experience! 

I thoroughly enjoyed the event, the sun was out in London as the 16,000 people descended on Hyde Park to take part. 

My time came in at 1:50:26 which I was insanely happy about as my goal was to get under 2 hours.

I just wanted to say a massive thank you to everyone who donated money to [Rocking Horse](http://www.rockinghorse.org.uk/), helping to raise £500 which I'm hoping Google will be able to match.
