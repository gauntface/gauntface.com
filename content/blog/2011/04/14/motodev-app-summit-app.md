# Motodev App Summit App 

This is only going to be a real quick blog post, but basically after signing up for the Motodev App Summit in London, I received an e-mail giving me extra information about the event as well as a link to download the Motodev App Summit App. Initial thoughts about this idea was . . . awesome, comments on speaks, bit of twitter integration, info about the speakers and how to get in touch and a fancy new app to look at.

Well . . . . . I downloaded and got this:

I wasn't overly impressed (Especially considering how one of the talks is on Android UI). So I mentioned to some of the guys over at Mubaloo we should code something up that evening to show a different approach to the app, showing how a.) you could get something much better b.) without spending too much time on it. But alas projects need finishing so it got put to one side, but after receiving a twitter comment from @motodev it just kicked me into gear, so this is the result of two hours of playing:

It's by no means perfect (I'm not a designer in any way shape of form) but I've stuck a nice gradient behind the tiled honeycomb pattern, added an Action Bar with the Motodev logo, removed the horrible Android titlebar, added some images for colour and customised the button widgets.

I'm planning on moving the honeycomb logo and Gaunt Face logos about a bit, then code up a couple of list views for the country selection and the talks (Largely cos I've quite gotten into now that it's started).
