# Android Headset - Full Example 

When working on my Thesis for my Masters I ended up needing to use the headset of the Nexus One and from that project I uploaded [a couple of code snippets](http://www.gauntface.co.uk/pages/blog/2010/04/14/using-android-headset-buttons-earphone-buttons/). Within the comments someone asked for a full example of working code and I said I would put one together. 

A little late I admit, but I have finally found the time to put it together, Â I had a little issue with the priority of the intent filter, but I have put a fix within the source code, although it is extremely hacky and I'm not particularly happy it being there. 

You can grab the source code from my github account: <https://github.com/gauntface/Android-Headset-Example> 

I tested this code on a Nexus One (2.2.2) and G1 (1.6), this is no guarantee with this code and there is a fair bit you could do to tidy up the registering and un-registering of the broadcast receivers. 

Any questions, post em in the comments :)
