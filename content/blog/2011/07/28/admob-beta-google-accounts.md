# Admob [Beta] + Google Accounts 

If you are a user of Admob and have opted to sign up with a Google Account or have migrated to a Google Account from an old Admob account, you'll need to perform the following tasks to use Admob [Beta]. 

  * First step is to login to [Admob.com](http://www.admob.com) on your PC.
  * Go to Account > Account Information
  * Enable the API Password if you haven't already: "Enable read-only API access to your account"
  * Use this API Password with your normal e-mail address to login to the application

I hope to implement a much nicer way of getting this information on behalf of the user, but it's all a matter of time. 

Any questions feel free to leave a comment :)
