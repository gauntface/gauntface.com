# Arch Linux - Apache Sites

I followed a number of steps in the arch linux LAMP guide and this is now the process for me to set up new sites:

```bash
sudo gedit /etc/httpd/conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf
```

Add this to the end of the file:

```xml
<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost

  DocumentRoot "/home/matt/Sites/GauntFace/Local"
  ServerName gauntface.local.co.uk

  <Directory /home/matt/Sites/GauntFace/Local/>
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
    AllowOverride All
    Order allow,deny
    allow from all
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

Then add the servername to the hosts file:

```bash
sudo gedit /etc/hosts
```

And add:

```
127.0.0.1 gauntface.local.co.uk
```

Finally restart the server and all should be well in the world:

```bash
sudo /etc/rc.d/httpd restart
```
