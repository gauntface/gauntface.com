# Arduino Fun Times

Nan over at Mubaloo bought an Arduino for everyone to have a little play with, so now here is my experience of working with the Arduino Uno.

**Step 1:** Go get the IDE -Â <http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software>

**Step 2:** The download for linux doesn't come in an deb, so you can add a menu entry by right clicking Applications > Edit Menu, then set the Name and comment accordingly, the command just needs to be on <Directory to Arduino IDE>/arduino

I set the logo image to image below.

**Step 3:** The IDE requires some library files, so you need to run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install avr-libc gcc-avr
```

After installing these bits I was able to write, compile and load my first sketch to the board and everything worked as expected :)
