# Amazon App Store is Disgusting 

After reading the story by Shifty Jelly about the Amazon App Store's "Free app of the day", I kind of felt that Amazon had let down the developer community and I didn't want to a part of it anymore. If you missed the article it's well worth a read: [Shifty Jelly - Amazon App Store : Rotten to the Core](http://shiftyjelly.wordpress.com/2011/08/02/amazon-app-store-rotten-to-the-core/). 

The post briefly mentions how the Amazon App Store doesn't allow developers to remove their applications, this gave me a slight hint of doubt to how valid the story was, but a quick check and yup, no remove, delete or un-publish button. 

Right so things weren't looking great, a quick search and I had a e-mail address to request removal. Side note, it's my application, why should I "request" removal when every other store lets me control it? Anyway, off I went and sent an e-mail, to which I received this response: 

> Hi Matt,

> Thank you for your message. We need to verify that you are removing the same app(s) from any Similar Services (defined as any Android OS application store which distributes in the U.S. and its territories and possessions) at the same time barring other agreements that may prevent you from listing the app(s) in the Amazon Appstore. Please refer to the Distribution Agreement for Amazon Appstore:
>
> 3.a. Delivery Commitment for Apps. You will deliver electronically to us and continue to make available during the Term all versions of all software applications, games or other digital products (including any special or collector’s editions) (i) that are designed for the Platform, (ii) for which you have the rights required under this Agreement, and (iii) that are the same versions and editions (except as otherwise provided in this Agreement) that you or your affiliates make available directly or indirectly to any Similar Service.... 
> 
> Please respond to confirm that your request for app(s) withdrawal is compliant with our policies. Once we hear back from you, we will verify and then let you know how we will proceed.

Essentially, remove your app from the Android Market because you agreed to these terms that what ever everyone else has, we have. Well not quite, I'd already broken this by not updating the single app I had on the Amazon App Store. The reason being that the Amazon App Store gave me less than 10 downloads throughout the entire duration of it being posted, so not a vital thing to update. But why does Amazon encourage this obscene ruling? 

What happened if I decided to deprecate an old application, pushing out vital updates, but making it as easy as possible to maintain. Do I really want to update an application in numerous places? 

After responding I was given the option of terminating the contract, which I gladly jumped at the opportunity. 

So in 10 days from receiving a response from their legal team the contract should be terminated. Hopefully this link will break soon ([http://www.amazon.com/Gaunt-Face-Admob-Beta/dp/B004Q6S8P8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=mobile-apps&qid=1312491224&sr=1-1](http://www.amazon.com/Gaunt-Face-Admob-Beta/dp/B004Q6S8P8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=mobile-apps&qid=1312491224&sr=1-1)) it's only been 24 hours so far, I'm sure it's a long process that could not be cut down to match Android's near instantaneous un-publishing. 

Just to top off everything I was kindly asked for some feedback: 

> In order to improve our offering we would appreciate feedback on why you are terminating your agreement. Thank you again for participating in the Amazon Appstore program -- if you have any other questions, or would like to contact us in the future about participation in the program, please visit the Amazon Appstore Developer Portal: <https://developer.amazon.com/welcome>

Well in all honesty, anyone who requires me to give up all control of my applications and wants to charge me $99 for the privilege, needs to rethink their strategy (I was _lucky_ enough to be invited for the first year free). Secondly, read the Shifty Jelly's article, thirdly, don't make the only way for me to remove an application, be to terminate my contract with you!! 

In a similar vain to Bill Bailey: "Hey Amazon, I ain't gonna be your bitch"
