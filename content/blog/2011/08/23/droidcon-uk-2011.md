# Droidcon UK 2011 

It's that time of year when all the conferences are a go and if you're an Android developer the key event you should have in your diary is [Droidcon UK 2011](http://uk.droidcon.com/). 

I attended the second day of the event last year (Was in project deadline mode for the first day unfortunately) and thoroughly enjoyed it. Judging by the speaker list so far it should be an unmissable event. 

The main talks I'd personally have on the top of my list: Richard Hyndman & Nick Butcher from Google, Mark Murphy form CommonsWare, Yosi Taguri from BlueVia (interesting revenue share opportunities with telefonica) and Kieran Gutteridge. 

If you've not been to this or any of the Londroid events, this is a great event to get to know some of the people in the Android community and I'm quite excited to see how much larger the community has grown. 

There are still some early bird tickets to go, so get 'em while you can: <http://uk.droidcon.com/content/register> 

Hopefully see you there :)
