# Update on the Ole' Gaunt Face Front

It's been a long time since I've posted on here . . . . . too long.

But I have been a little bit busy :)

I left my Android team at Mubaloo over a month ago to join the awesome folks over at Future Platforms and as Tom Hume put it, I had a "baptism of fire" for my first project. I was started straight away on the Glastonbury application for Android developing the custom schedule screen and then progressing on to the other areas of the app with James Hugman.

Since the release, it was featured on the Android Market, *making it the second app I've worked on to get featured in the Android Market #cough * and now working on a new project for Symbian and getting to grip with Qt.

Hopefully since I've now settled down in Brighton and got the flat set up I will start to get on with some of my own projects and also get round to open sourcing some bits of code here and there. I also hope to get back into attending some events, something I feel I've stopped doing recently as well as giving any talks, so anyone looking for a speaker on mobile feel free to drop me an email ;)
