# LastMinute.com + Nokia + Qt & Me 

I've been working with team Phaedrus at Future Platforms HQ to develop the Qt version of LastMinute.com's hotel booking application. 

Being one of the first Qt projects I'd worked on, I was amazed at how easy it was to get to grips with Qt Quick, Nokia's technique for developing applications in QML and Javascript. 

After the application was finished Nokia asked if we would be happy to talk about our experience developing with Qt and you can see the result below.

If you wanted to hear other developers experience with Qt then look no further than <http://www.developer.nokia.com/Develop/Qt/Videos/>.
