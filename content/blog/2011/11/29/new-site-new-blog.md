# New Site & New Blog 

Oh yeah. 

The site was looking a little bit outdated and it wasn't quite fitting my needs: 

  1. I struggled to adding sections to the site at a whim, at least now it consists of small chunks of content I can add, edit and remove.
  2. It was old and looked it
  3. I wanted an excuse to play with a little HTML5
  4. I wasn't particularly happy with the format of the blog and hopefully the simplified look and feel will encourage me to post on a regular basis.

If you find any problems with the site please give me a shout, otherwise go and check out [gauntface.co.uk](http://www.gauntface.co.uk/)Â and enjoy the blog. 

p.s. I'm sorry for out right blocking users of IE9 or less . . . . but unfortunately I don't want to cater for such a small portion of my visitors by building vasts amount of backwards compatibility.
