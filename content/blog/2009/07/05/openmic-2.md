# OpenMIC #2

So I went along to the OpenMIC event in Bristol which was a conference with speakers from Vodafone BetaVine, Intohand, WeLoveMobile, Wireless Wanders and Paul Golding. After the talks there were 2 bar camps held on a number of topics suggested by some of the attendees. Obviously, the day ended with a few beers in the bar.

All in all it was a great event, just getting other peoples views on any and all mobile topics with a range of people from various fields related to mobile phones, not just developers.

I would strongly recommend that anyone with the opportunity to attend, should take it, its a great event to spend some time with like minded people.
