# So I've been away for a while . . . 

I haven't been blogging or updating my website for quite some time . .

I've been busy moving house and learning Android development. So far I've really enjoyed it, everyone on the IRC room (#android-dev) is great and I strongly recommend anyone interested in Android development join the chat to just learn from other peoples questions (including mine :-P) and ask questions you might have.

Anyway I'll probably start loading up some little tutorials to explain how certain tasks may be achieved, since I have failed to come across some examples to accomplish certain tasks, although I don't have an Android device to test things on yet, the emulator is amazingly accurate from what I've done so far and tested on a co-workers G1.

In the mean time keep checking my twitter feed for mini updates :-)

p.s. I personally am not a big fan of Flash on websites, but this is just too kool (or geeky) not to include
