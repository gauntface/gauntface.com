# Wordpress Woop Woop 

![wordpress-logo-hoz-rgb](/uploads/images/blog/2009/08/wordpress-logo-hoz-rgb.png)

So I changed from Drupal to Wordpress, why?. . . because I loves it I does!

To be honest I didn't give Drupal a fair try, but I felt I could develop my site faster without a full blown CMS as there aren't any problems with fairly trivial things.

Anyway this design is probably very few people's cup of tea but one thing I love is the speech bubble comment boxes below for comments, leave a message to see what I mean ;-) and my sliding tabs (Twitter, Wordpress and Flickr) - again give 'em a click to see what I mean.

But in all seriousness please post me a comment if you like the design or can suggest any improvements.

p.s. Hopefully I'll post some useful blog stuff soon :-)
