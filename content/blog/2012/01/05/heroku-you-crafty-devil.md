# Heroku You Crafty Devil 

After using Heroku for a new project, these are the commands which I need learn and remember. Until then, I'm jotting them down here as I go along: 

##  Lists the Currently Running Processes - Heroku Process State.

`heroku ps`

## Scale Processes

`heroku ps:scale web=1` `heroku ps:scale <Process Name>=<No of Instances>`

## Logs

`heroku logs`

## Open

`heroku open`
