# Agile - Are You or Aren't You? 

One of the weirdest things I found when working for various companies whether that's as a developer within a company, or simply a developer using desk space in a client office, it's always fascinating discussing and seeing how other development houses are run. 

They'll tend to mention agile development methodologies and for the most part companies will say something along the lines of "Yes we are an agile development house". But are they? Wheres the line between non-agile and agile? Would a company actually admit to being something other than agile? 

I guess the biggest issue for me is since working in companies where elements of agile were introduced and simply didn't work to working in Future Platforms alongside the spectacular Scrum Master Cori Samuels, it kind of becomes clear where the others may have been going wrong. 

Scrum for me makes a great deal of sense in development, especially when working on mobile apps which can be relatively small time to turn around. The reason I think it works so well is that by sticking to a great deal of agile methodologies and iteratively tweaking them to work with a team is kind of the key. 

The obvious thing to get misunderstood is the purpose of stand-ups, it's a catch up. It's easy for dev's to get wired in and not talking, so catch up and stating plans for the day ahead is a no brainer. If this turns into a hour sat down meeting (and yes I have friends where this is the case) then something has been lost in translation. 

Retro's are a fantastic way of giving kudos, stating things you enjoyed, things you didn't and problems you have. As a developer I would love to continue working in companies which do this on a team basis. But at the same it does open things up to saying what you disagree about within a company, while this is constructive criticism, it is criticism none the less and you have to give credit to anyone who can take it on board and work with it to improve everyone's work life. 

At the end of the day I think it's easy to overlook process if it's just about ticking over, but if thats the case Scrum Masters like Cori are the exact kind of people you want to work at perfecting a teams process.
