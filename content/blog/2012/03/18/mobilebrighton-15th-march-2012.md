# #MobileBrighton - 15th March 2012

Last thursday I gave a talk on the approach I take to target the various Android screen sizes. I was bit unsure how to Â get the information across since it was predominantly an iOS crowd (the group was originally an iOS group before changing to be mobile). 

All in all I think it went well and people found it useful. I've put the slides up on slideshare.
