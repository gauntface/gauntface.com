# Skillset Academi+ - Mobile Apps & Content Creation 

![Skillset Academi+ Matt Gaunt Presentation](/images/blog/2012/03/AorR_InCQAAIc5q.jpg) 

Last Friday I was invited by Adam Martin to give a presentation on the current state of affairs in the mobile space. Despite the tube problems (damn you circle line) I got there on time. As usual it was a great crowd and I hope they enjoyed. 

There may be a video at a later stage but not sure Adam's plans with that. Here's the slides and of course you are free to download them.
