# New version of gauntface.com

There is a general cadence for me to change my site once every year or two, either because I
get tired of the look of it or the stack is just not working for me.

## Old stack

The previous version of my site was using a custom built static site generator and I bailed on
it because I was starting to want features that were common in all other static site generators
and I couldn't justify the work.

The reason I had built the generator was because I had this idea of templates being able to define the CSS and JS they needed and as part of the template generation the CSS and JS would be added as necessary. I
was largely happy with the end result but there was enough rough edges that it was a "death by a thousand papercuts" kind of feeling.

The other details of the tech I used:

- Hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [Custom static site generator](https://github.com/gauntface/hopin-static-site)
- Markdown for content
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) for asset compilation & minification
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for in page JS
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) for styles

## New stack

The new stack has some old and new in it and the biggest driver for the change was to switch to
a widely used static site generator, which resulted in:

- âœ¨ Hosting on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- âœ¨ [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for static site generation
- âœ¨ Custom scripts from ["go-html-asset-manager"](https://github.com/gauntface/go-html-asset-manager) 
    for production builds
- ðŸ‘Œ Markdown for content
- ðŸ‘Œ [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) for asset compilation & minification
- ðŸ‘Œ [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for in page JS
- ðŸ‘Œ [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) for styles

That's three new (âœ¨) things and a bunch of tools I've stuck with (ðŸ‘Œ).

I stuck with markdown, Gulp, Typescript and PostCSS because they all work for me and I've had
enough of an issue with any of them to really opt for anything else that's I've seen and / or tried.

Now, why the changes?

### AWS for hosting

The move to AWS was driven by a desire to learn AWS. Netlify has a fantastic feature set and 
I'd still recommend it to folks if they haven't tried it. (I may go back once I get a feel for
the average cost of AWS).

AWS Hosting is simple, store the site in an S3 bucket with Cloudfront for the CDN, you 
can [learn more in this post](/blog/2020/static-site-hosting-on-aws/).

The deployment of the site is managed by 
[a GitHub Action](https://github.com/gauntface/gauntface.com/blob/master/.github/workflows/publish.yml)
so I didn't lose the auto-deploy feature that Netlify provided.

### Hugo for site generation

After working in golang for the past few years I wanted to try [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), I'd
heard nothing but good things about it, so why not right?

The performance of Hugo is fantastic. My site builds in < 3s containing ~150 posts and the dev 
server can update individual pages in < 200ms.

[Theming in Hugo](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/theme-components/) has been fun to work with 
because you can apply more than one theme, which I'm using to have a "base" theme and a site 
specific theme. The base theme includes common partials, layouts etc used by multiple sites
and the site specific theme adds partials and layouts for this site, falling back to the base
theme where appropriate.

### Custom script: go-html-asset-manager

`go-html-asset-manager` is a Go program I created to help optimise my site without
needing to change the content and / or tying myself to Hugo for site generation.

Some of the operations it performs:

- Generates multiple sizes and types of images
- Replaces `img` tags to `picture` elements
- Wraps iframes in `div`s to maintain aspect ratio
- Replaces YouTube iframes with a still frame and load the iframe asynchronously
    - H/T to [@addyosmani](https://twitter.com/addyosmani) for showing my 
        [lite-youtube-embed](https://github.com/paulirish/lite-youtube-embed)
- Adds CSS & JS

A lot of these operations are simple translations. The injection of the CSS & JS is probably the
most quirky part of my site.

During a dev build of my site the `go-html-asset-manager` script isn't used, instead 
one of my themes adds **all* of the CS and JS files.

The template looks a little like this:

```go
{{- define "base-load-dev-assets-dir" -}}
  {{- range (readDir $.dir) -}}
    // Add file to the rendered template if it's a CSS or JS file
  {{- end -}}
{{- end -}}

{{ if (not (eq hugo.Environment "production")) }}
  {{ range (slice "/themes" "/static") }}
    {{ if (fileExists .) }}
      {{ template "base-load-dev-assets-dir" (dict "dir" .) }}
    {{ end }}    
  {{ end }}
{{ end }}  
```

This will add `<script src="<file>">` and `<link rel="stylesheet" href="<file>">` to
the `head` of the rendered page. This is great for local development, just adding a CSS 
or JS file ends up being loaded in every page. It is the worst thing to do for performance,
illustrated in the video below where I throttle the network connection.

**TODO ADD VIDEO OF DEV LOADING PERF**

In production build of my site no styles or scripts are added to the pages, it is
left up to `go-html-asset-manager` to add the assets and it does in the following
way.

1. For each page a set of "keys" are generated consistig of the HTML tags, classnames 
    and attribute keys in the file.
1. Any files found in the site with one of the following formats is added to the page:
    1. `<key>.<css | js>`: These files are read from the file system and the contents
        is inlined in the page, wrapped in `<style>` or `<script>` tags.
    1. `<key>-sync.<css | js>`: This files are added to the head of body of the page
        and block the page while they are loaded.
    1. `<key>-async.<css | js>`: These files are added to the body of the page
        and loaded asynchronously. For Javascript files this relies on `async defer`
        attributes. CSS is loaded asynchrnously by Javascript.
    1. `<key>-preload.<css | js>`: Will add a `link` tag with `rel="preload"`.

This naming convention for files has worked out really well. I stick to a 
[BEMIT](https://csswizardry.com/2015/08/bemit-taking-the-bem-naming-convention-a-step-further/)
naming convention for classes and just looking at my files I can tell what is going
to happen to a page.

The end result is a lot more performant as well:

**TODO ADD VIDEO OF PROD LOADING PERF**

The **good part** of `go-html-asset-manager` is that it enables the content and themes to be kept
simple while resulting in an efficient site , plus this tool is agnostic to the site generator used
to generate the output.

The **bad part** of `go-html-asset-manager` is that some of the mutations can cause differences
in the final appearance. For example, wrapping iframes to ensure a 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratio
can be different from the development builds which show the iframe added to the markdown file.

## What next

Overall I've been really happy with the end result and it's made it really easy to improve the
performance of my site in a consistent way.

I don't have too much planned for the current set up outside of improving the development of
styleguides for my themes which are still a little iffy to develop and work with.
