# Android Apps - How to Get Your Problems Fixed 

I recently announced the release of Facebook Sync, after perfecting the UI, getting it to work for devices running Android 1.5 - 2.1, testing it on my G1, Nexus One & friends HTC Hero and T-Mobile Pulse, I put it on the Market and now I need your the help, yes you the user! I knew people would experience problems, everyone has unique contacts and Facebook friends, I've tried to think of all possible outcomes, but some have still slipped through.

So you've installed Facebook Sync and you're having a problem where the application force closes, what do you do?

**Simply do the following:**

  1. Download "Log Collector" a free app from the Android Market, then run Facebook Sync until it force closes, then straight after, open Log Collector and send the output to apps@gauntface.co.uk.
  2. Then finally drop me an e-mail, I'd love to hear your suggestions, problems and explanations that make the app close, and more than likely I will ask if you could a little bit of testing before I release the fix to everyone

This will give me far more information about the problem than a comment along the lines of "It doesn't work".

Thanks for all the users who have been enjoyer Facebook Sync and I hope to fix any problems others are experiencing. *A big thank you to the users who have contacted me already about problems and the fixes they have helped me make

Cheers,<br />Matt

p.s. This technique of helping me with Facebook Sync can and does apply to every other app, just make sure you know the developers e-mail address and most developers include it in the app description.
