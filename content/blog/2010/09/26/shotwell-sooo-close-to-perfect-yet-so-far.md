  Shot well is an open source image manager, much like iPhoto on Mac's.
  
  It's damn good with just a few usability issues.

# Shotwell, sooo Close to Perfect, Yet so Far 

Shotwell is by far the best photo management software I've used on linux, it far surpasses picasa with its easy to use interface, taking a similar approach to iPhoto for Mac OS X. The polish on the application is fantastic, something many linux application lack.

It offers publishing features for Facebook, Flickr and Picasa Web Albums, but alas this is where my own personal tastes and this little program go our separate ways.

One of the main problems I have, is the actual use of the publishing feature, it opens in a separate window (which is good) however while it's uploading your photos, it prevents you from being able to do anything else. Simply put, they need to thread this as a user I can look through my photos while waiting for them to upload.

Secondly, there is no way to manage your uploaded photos within the Shotwell application, now I admit this is a pretty tall order as it requires a great deal of work to get this sort of integration, so I won't argue over this too much.

But those two things aside, Shotwell is awesome and you should all be using, because nothing else compares to it.
