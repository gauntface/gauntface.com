# Toshiba You Beauty 

The fantastic Toshiba have mentioned they are throwing their hat into the tablet ring with 2 devices, one android device and one dual screen Windows device.

Alot of people are "claiming" it's the courier or mentioning it sounds like it, but you can also see a dual screen MSI tablet, where one screen is touch screen the other is not (I don't think, judging from the video's I saw). So this is more likely to be just Windows on a dual screen device. Although on a side note, it would be interesting if Microsoft teams up with Toshiba to make the courier hardware while Microsoft created the software. The reason I mention this would be interesting is because it would be very similar to Google's approach with Android and HTC. Google: "We don't do hardware, we do software, so we teamed up with someone to do the hardware with us".

Anyway, back on track, I don't feel confident that it is going to be the courier, BUT when it does get released I am going to try my hardest to slap Android on top of that bad boy and get developing the courier interface.

Let it begin.
