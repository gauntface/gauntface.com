# More News on the  MS Courier

It's not getting released till next year :-(

The new york times have posted a story saying sources inside Microsoft have expressed concerns over battery life, but also a change in where to market the device.

I appreciate there are some technical concerns with the hardware and I would prefer Microsoft fixed this rather than release a half baked product leaving everyone frustrated they spent good money on such a product.

But to claim they don't know where to market it?

What?

They were "apparently" targeting designers andÂ architects, but "lately the company is thinking of a broader market of consumers and so would include e-books, magazines and other media content on the device".

Come on, how stupid does a company have to be? I'd be livid if I bought this device and it wasn't capable of showing e-books, and as for other media content, I can only assume they mean video and music playback (Well every bit of electrical equipment has video and music playback to some degree or another, so why leave it out? 

I know this is all a rumour, but this is exactly the type of thing that frustrates me with Microsoft, they should be capable of seeing the potential from that video and I think they are right to look for a broader market than designers and architects, but I don't think they would need to change anything.

I just hope Microsoft release some solid information about the Courier sooner rather than later, because if they don't I will happily just jump ship sometime over the next year, because this mythical bit of kit seems further away than ever.
