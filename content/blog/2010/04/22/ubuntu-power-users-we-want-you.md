# Ubuntu Power Users - We Want You! 

![Ubuntu Loading Screen](/uploads/images/blog/2010/04/boot.png)

Jono Bacon came up with this concept of creating a community for power users, those that want to do more with Ubuntu, other than just install and run programs. A couple of peeps are now starting to build up the idea of what / how we are going to approach setting up this community.

Me (gauntface), [Brandon Tomlinson (thebwt)](http://thebwt.com/) and [Toni Korpela (TMKCodes)](http://tmkcodes.kicks-ass.org/) have started discussing couple of things and thebwt has started setting up a mailing list, so hopefully we will have some kool things going soon.

So you've read this far in, good stuff, now have a little look into this if you are planning on helping with articles:

[http://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct](http://www.ubuntu.com/community/conduct)

Then jump on over to the IRC channel on freenode - #ubuntu-tweakers (There might be an article on IRC etc later, but for now you'll have to google it :-D)

If you'd like to see what we chatted about, the first chunk of the irc is here - [http://thebwt.com/tweakersLog.txt](http://thebwt.com/tweakersLog.txt)
