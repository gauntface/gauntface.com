I was lucky enough to attend the Android Developer Labs (ADL) 2010 in London and we were the first batch (of many on the ADL world tour) to receive a free Nexus One courtesy  of Google (and a huge thanks to the host Reto Meier).

Anyway I've been playing with it since that day and love it, I don't have any gripes about it, what so ever.

I admit the lack of multi-touch was a pain in the back side- but as soon as I got back from London, sure enough the blogosphere was alive with comments about the multi-touch update being pushed. (I cannot begin to tell you how good those couple of days were lol!)

Here are some photo's I took, and anyone reading this curious about the Nexus One, just go for it, any questions just post a comment :-)

Fact: Nexus One the first Linux phone Linus Torvalds didn't hate
