# Series 2 Droplets by the Awesome @JamFactory

Last week on saturday was the launch of the series 2 droplets, and well . . . they are just awesome!!!

@JamFactory sold out of the little slick ricks in 58 minutes at the fifty fifty store Bristol after throwing a cool shindig with custom Droplets galore on display. However never fear, if you want some of your own, check out [Crazylabel](//www.crazylabel.com/toys/droplet).

But also [@JamFactory](https://twitter.com/JamFactory) got the amazing word today that the IT Crowd Series 4 want some of his Droplets for the show, so congratulations to him for that!!!
