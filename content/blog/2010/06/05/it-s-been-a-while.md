# It's been a while... 

I haven't been on the internet over the past week or 2 and this is purely because of: 

  1. Finishing Thesis
  2. Celebrating the finishing of the Thesis
  3. Sorting out new flat
  4. Preparing for a presentation on the contents of my thesis

But the end of my student life is near, as of Wednesday evening I will be  finished with uni. But this is the start of some rather fun stuff.

I will start work with Mubaloo (The best smart phone development team anywhere!). I will also be able to fix some bugs in Facebook Sync and get started in furthering my knowledge of Android, helping out with Ubuntu One's Android application with Mike, Start development of the Shot of Jaq app and some other projects I have been thinking about.

But I'm also hoping to get the Ubuntu power user's community set-up, which at the moment I've stepped out of the lime light just to avoid temptation.

Along all of this, I hope to start re-designing my website, which needs a load of work to bring it up to web 2.0 standards, customise it for smart-phones and maybe even the iPad (Just to see what the best process is :-P). This redesign will also include re-typing and setting up a number of tutorials for Android and Ubuntu. The main culprit is the Android Proximity Alerts which a number of people are having problems with.

Anyway, I'm still alive, I am still working hard and a number of new awesome things are about to start, I canny wait!!!

p.s. Be nice to your app developers
