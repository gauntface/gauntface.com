# Hard Drive Icon Version 1 - Download 

I've uploaded my first attempt at making some hard-drive icons to use in my own icon set.

Please let me know what you think.

NOTE: I apologise that this isn't I direct link, My Bandwidth is getting hit pretty hard from all the downloads so I've had to host the files somewhere else, I will try to find an alternative to this.
