# Programming Mimetype Icons 

![Small Example of Programming Mimetype Icons](/uploads/images/blog/2009/08/displayPM1.png)

I made a set of programming file mimetype icons.

I used them just to make them easier to identify. 

NOTE: I apologise that this isn't I direct link, My Bandwidth is getting hit pretty hard from all the downloads so I've had to host the files somewhere else, I will try to find an alternative to this.
