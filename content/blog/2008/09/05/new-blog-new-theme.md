# New Blog, New Theme . . . 

Hi everyone,

Welcome to my new blog, after changing hosts with some helpful advice from the folks at forums.overclockers.co.uk, I decided a blog would be useful to post events and news of whats going on.

Soon I'll be attending the ''IBM Thinkpad Challenge" where teams from universities all over the UK are invited to visit the IBM labs at Winchester with the chance of winning a Thinkpad each for one team.

Anyway I'll do my best to update regularly with tutorials that will be posted here.
