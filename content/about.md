# Hi, I'm Matt

I'm a software engineer and nerd at heart.

Since graduating I've worked on a number of different projects and tech stacks,
some of which are listed below.

Right now my passion lies in testing and DevOPs. The ability to build something
maintainable and self-sustaining brings me a whole bunch of joy.
