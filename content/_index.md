# Hello.

Please excuse the dust, I'm in the middle of changing my site, again, but
if you are looking for the website owned by Matt Gaunt you are in the right

Hopefully the lockdown in California will help me fix it up quickly.

## Projects

### Web Push Book

Having spent a large amount of time playing with web push I put together a collection of information into a kind of book that you can grab [from the web-push-book](https://web-push-book.gauntface.com/).

### Smashing Book 5

I've written a chapter in the [Smashing Book 5](https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/products/smashing-book-5-real-life-responsive-web-design) on service workers and it's now available in print or ebook.
