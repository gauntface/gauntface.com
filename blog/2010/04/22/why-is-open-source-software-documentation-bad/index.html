<h1 id="why-is-open-source-software-documentation-bad">Why is Open Source Software Documentation Bad?</h1>
<p>I&#39;ve just gotten off the IRC of the #ubuntu-tweakers room on irc.freenode.net and we were having a full-blown discussion on why there is this huge barrier to entry with open source software.</p>
<p>The main area&#39;s that we all agreed on were the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>The programmer doesn&#39;t know the tools which are used</li>
<li>The programmer is lost the minute they get into the code</li>
</ol>
<p>and one thing I&#39;d tag onto that is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Where the hell is everything? (Bug tracker, info on commiting patches, stuff I should know but you haven&#39;t told me about so I can&#39;t even know I should know it, let alone then finding information on it)</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&#39;s look at an example of an open source program, Gnome-Do for instance (<a href="http://do.davebsd.com/development.shtml">http://do.davebsd.com/development.shtml</a>).</p>
<p>We can see, development has a link at the top - so far so good - <a href="http://do.davebsd.com/development.shtml">http://do.davebsd.com/development.shtml</a></p>
<p>There is a wealth of information there, Mono, links to the mono site, it&#39;s in C# with a link to the wikipedia page on it, I have links to irc and even the developers blogs and twitter feeds. Then we have a link to launchpad.</p>
<p>Now I&#39;ve never used launchpad in my life, it&#39;s a daunting tool, to say the least.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I know it has everything you could want in a development platform. But all I wanted to do was download the source, install the relevant packages and tools to get developing and then start building a plugin or change to gnome-do.</p>
<p>What&#39;s actually happened:</p>
<ol>
<li>I&#39;ve been sent on a wild goose chase to learn about Mono, what is relevant to Gnome-Do specifically? I don&#39;t know, so your guess is as good as mine.</li>
<li>I&#39;ve been sent to a wikipedia page for C# which I imagine is the last place I&#39;d want to look for on programming info.</li>
<li>Been told they use launchpad and then that is it in terms of repo etc.</li>
<li>Remember the things I should know but don&#39;t know I should know them? Well what happens if I add something, what do I do? Should launchpad have this info? should their project site have it?</li>
</ol>
<p>Jono Bacon mentions alot of the time about - opportunistic programming and how Quickly enables that, and he&#39;s totally right, it&#39;s easy to knock up a program in many cases, that just scratches a little itch. But what happens if you don&#39;t want opportunistic programming starting from scratch, but in some other projects code? Is this even possible?</p>
<p>This is in no way a dig at gnome-do (honestly I love your guys work and I can bet if I went in the irc these questions would be answered). It&#39;s just I&#39;ve looked at your development site before when I started programming and I got lost very quickly.</p>
<p>The main point I&#39;m trying to get at, is does open source, think enough about the people who want to get involved but can&#39;t, because of this seemingly high barrier?</p>
<p>I think the following would of changed things for the Gnome-Do example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Instead of a link to the Mono Documentation, perhaps just a small documentation, explaining how to install, set-up, create new projects and import projects, rather than the mono page itself (Which at the end of the day may have this information, but it&#39;s mixed in with the advertising stuff and how do I know what&#39;s relevant to just getting a move on).</li>
<li>instead of a C# link to a page just about C# why not another documentation on just getting started with C# including (again) how to install, set-up and use C# (including the relevant links to documentation and useful/key links)</li>
<li>A video on how to use Launchpad, what everything is, and where to find everything</li>
<li>Documentation directly relevant to the project (This is the bit I will never expect to happen, I&#39;ll explain why in a bit)</li>
</ol>
<p>Basically, relevant documentation, that just tells me, how to get moving. I don&#39;t care about the in&#39;s and out&#39;s I just want to go, same as Quickly, you don&#39;t care what Quickly does to build your app, you just care that it starts to work. Everything else you can work out, as and when you need to.</p>
<p>The video of Launchpad, because I simple don&#39;t want to read a whole set of docs on it, it&#39;s far too much info to take in, from just text, it would be easier and far more pleasant through a video format.</p>
<p>Now the final comment, why do I think a project wouldn&#39;t produce documentation for new-comers, because it&#39;s a lot of effort. I&#39;ve developed in small teams, and the last thing you want to do is comment stuff - it&#39;s boring. But there must be some way of getting across the structure of an app right? I mean, I downloaded the VLC Media Player source, and I couldn&#39;t find where a play function was, the code was so foreign to me, yet if I had their file structure drawn in a graph format, I would probably be able to follow exactly where I should of been looking. But again this requires someone to do it, but would it take long for an experienced developer to scan in a drawn picture of a program structure?</p>
<p>As for the main documentation for tools etc, I might take some of the doc&#39;s written for the Ubuntu Tweakers community and turn it into something suited for projects to simply link to.</p>
<p>This is obviously my own point of view and I have no doubt someone will disagree with me every step of the way, and if that is the case then please comment because I do find this a really interesting topic.</p>
